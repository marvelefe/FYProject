# Malaria Detection in Blood Samples Using Convolutional Neural Networks
The ultimate goal of this work was to develop a system for detecting malaria using microscopic images of stained blood
samples.

# Conclusion
The Neural Network successfully trained on 1,000 images with a training
and validation accuracy of 100.00% respectively and it was tested on the images of four blood
samples that it had not seen before and further classified them as infected or uninfected with a
100% accuracy.
