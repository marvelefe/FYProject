# Malaria Detection in Blood Samples Using Convolutional Neural Networks 
 Convolutional neural networks are a machine learning algorithm that is used primarily to classify images (by naming what they see), cluster them by resemblance and similarity (photo search), and perform detailed object recognition within scenes. They are algorithms that can spot and identify faces, objects, street signs, plants, tumors, platypuses and many other aspects of visual data. The efficacy of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image recognition is one of the main reasons why the world has woken up to the efficacy of deep learning.
